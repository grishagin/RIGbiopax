\arguments{
\item{work_dir}{Directory, where all source files/folders are located and will be written to.}

\item{source_owl_dir}{Directory with \code{*.owl} files. 
If no directory provided, a prompt will pop up. See \code{load.biopax} function for more information.}

\item{output_dir}{.}

\item{pw_matchup_file}{File that provides match-up between inxight pathway names and BioPAX pathway names.}

\description{
Main function of the package. Extract all proteins ("genes") from a BioPAX source, 
convert their IDs to gene IDs and Symbols, and then compare those to a supplied gene list.
