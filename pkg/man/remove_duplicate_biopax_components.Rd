\title{Remove Duplicate Components from BioPAX Object}
\usage{
remove_duplicate_biopax_components(biopax)
}
\description{
BioPAX objects frequently have components that are identical in everything, but id. 
This function removes all such duplicates, and changes all property_attr_values accordingly.
}
\details{
The biopax is processed iteratively.\cr
First, two sets of properties are used to identify and remove:\cr
1) duplicate term-db-id, db-id, and position-status instances;\cr
2) duplicate instances that refer to instance listed in 1) -- 
they have properties xref, term, evidenceCode, featureLocation, 
modificationType, sequenceIntervalBegin, sequenceIntervalEnd. \cr\cr
Second, two sets of classes are used to identify and remove:\cr
1) duplicate Protein, SmallMolecule, PhysicalEntity, RNA, DNA instances;\cr
2) duplicate Complex instances.\cr
